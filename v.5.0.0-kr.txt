new features)
lipsync (exe built-in)
rain effect
boat effect
draw images with timestamp (or interval)



channel : provide 10 channels, channel number : 0~9 (MAX_CHANNEL_NUM = 10)
!! channel 0 is used for voice !!
override when channel number is same

mode :  0 - off, 1 - once, 2 - loop

priority : specifies the image priority when overlap
In the same priority, the lower#channel is seen above
(look at the list below)

[SCREEN]
(-1) : forced to show during effect
(1)
[button]
(2)
[text window]
(3)
[sprite2] (!windowback_flag)
(4)
[sprite] (above z_order, look 'humanz' command)
(5)
[sprite2] (windowback_flag)
(6)
[standing]
(7)
[sprite] (below z_order)
(8) : recommended use for transparent background (rainy)
(9) : recommended use for rain
[background]


■ simul_play NUM
channel

play the channel (set with simul_set)
for proper sync, set channel with pre_load before play .ogg


■ simul_off NUM
channel

off channel


■ simul_offall

off all channel


■ simul_sysoff NUM
on(1)/off(0)

on/off whole system


■ simul_lip NUM
on(1)/off(0)

on/off lipsync channel(channel 0)
you can use 'simul_off 0', but recommended to use 'simul_lip 0'


■ simul_nextld NUM
id (based on script, ex. id 1 : KIN, id 27 : BEA)

force id of next ld (or mld)


■ simul_nextvoice NUM
id

force id of next voice (until 'simul_nextvoice 0' called)


■ simul_lipall NUM
on(1)/off(0)

on(1) to enable all lips of standing images with same id (ex. lots of beatrice)


■ simul_ch_witheff NUM NUM
channel, on(1)/off(0)

on(1) to active channel when drawing effect, like priority -1


■ simul_set NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM STR NUM
channel, mode, priority, pre_load, interval(ms), first image filename, number of images
Example)
simul_set 2, 1, 1, 1, 30, ":bc;animation\door\01.jpg", 74
simul_play 2

from the first image(ex. ani01.png, 01.jpg... must start with 01), draw the images for every interval
(image number : 01~99, 100~999)
pre_load : off(0) to postpone loading : load separately, just before that image is drawn (use for long interval)
on(1) to load all images immediately
(ex. set between text and @, pre_load while user reads text, so prevent feeling the load)


■ simul_set_manual NUM NUM NUM NUM STR NUM
channel, mode, priority, pre_load, first image filename, number of images
Example)
simul_set_manual 2, 1, 1, 1, ":b;movie\ep8_wd_subtitles\01.png", 19
simul_ch_witheff 2, 1
simul_play 2

like simul_set, but use timestamps instead of interval
require .txt file that contain timestamps
ex) 'ani01.png', 'ani02.png', ..., 'ani05.png'
'anistamp.txt' has the following timestamps
(for 01.jpg, stamp.txt)
200 // at 200ms, draw ani01.png
400
700
1000
1200
1400 // at 1400ms, off all images or start loop


■ simul_makerain NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM
channel, priority, interval(ms), num of rain, width scale of rain(% of origin), min length of rain(% of screen_height), max length
Example)
simul_makerain 7, 9, 15, 300, 200, 20, 30
simul_ch_witheff 7, 1

raindrop with random length generated
off when next 'bg' called && 'simul_ch_witheff' was (0)
set interval 100000000(Exception) to pause rain better (in this case, doesn't off when next 'bg' called)
(no need 'simul_play')


■ simul_bg2 NUM STR NUM NUM NUM
channel, image filename, pos.x, pos.y, opacity
Example)
simul_makerain 7, 9, 15, 100, 100, 5, 10
simul_bg2 9, ":b;bmp\background2\garden_r1an.png", -254, -143, 255
(-254, -143 for 2429x1366 image)

use to draw additional background (priority 8)
off when next 'bg' called
(no need 'simul_play')


■ simul_shake NUM NUM NUM NUM
channel, interval(ms), x period, y period(ms)
Example)
simul_shake 8, 15, 2500, 2000

at boat scene, shake screen (before text window, priority 3~9)
shake x 20, y 80 at 1920x1080
(recommended to use with simul_bg2)
(recommended to keep useing the same channel)
(no need 'simul_play')
